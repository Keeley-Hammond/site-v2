Happy Monday! It's going to be a busy week this week - my father is coming to visit on Tuesday, I'm traveling to Seattle on business for Tuesday & Wednesday, and my birthday is on Thursday. So this will just be a quick reminder of events happening.

Here's what's going on in Portland this week and next week:

### Events

If you're in PDX tech:

- [Tues, 7/11: Portland ReactJS Lighting Talks and Hack Night.](https://www.meetup.com/Portland-ReactJS/events/241125197/) Portland ReactJS is holding a monthly lightning talk and presentation night at New Relic.
- [Thurs, 7/13: PDXNode Presentation Night.](https://www.meetup.com/pdxnode/events/238627202/) So bummed that I can't attend this week, but if you're free, you should. PDXNode is an awesome group, and this month they're starting off with a friendly Node quiz! Prizes include awesome learning materials sponsored by Cloudflare (eg. Books like "Effective JavaScript" by David Herman, and "Node.js in Action" by Harter, Cantelon, Rajlich, and Holowaychuk).
- [Thurs, 7/13: WWC Networking Night @ Wieden+Kennedy - Intro to VR & Wearable Tech.](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/networking-night-wiedenkennedy-intro-to-vr-wearable-tech-tickets-35443175492) Pretty excited about this one - and it's on my birthday! Our July Networking Night will be hosted by the W+K Lodge, Wieden + Kennedy's design engineering group. There will be a series of workshops including an Intro to VR Development, a Live Art Demo of Google’s Tilt Brush app, and a Build Your Own LED Bracelet Wearable. Come by!

### Non-Tech Events:

Promoting my usual two running meetups; if you need a crew of people to run with, come join us:

- [Portland Running Company: Thirsty Thursday 4-6 mile run @ 6:00p.](https://www.meetup.com/Portland-Running-Co-Weekly-Group-Runs/events/238871360/)
- [PDX Trail Runners: Saturday at 9:00a @ Forest Park, on the Lower MacLeay Park entrance.](https://www.meetup.com/PDX-Trail-Runners/events/237741875/)

### Articles

Here are a few articles, podcasts and assorted things that I’ve enjoyed over the past week — give yourself a little mental boost on your Monday morning:

- Remember @noopkat, who I mentioned last week as [having great weekly live streams?](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/156064343) She wrote a blog recently about [her experience live streaming her open source work for a full year.](http://meow.noopkat.com/lessons-from-one-year-of-streaming-on-twitch/) She provides details about her schedule, as well as her technical setup, for anyone who's looking to get into streaming.
- I thought this was a good writeup on a classic interview question: [Three ways to reverse a string in Javascript.](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-reverse-a-string-in-javascript-in-3-different-ways-75e4763c68cb) It's written by the folks over at freeCodeCamp, and does a nice job of showing different solutions and approaches.
- Finally, I know I've mentioned her before, but a shoutout to [Vaidehi Joshi's Base CS Series, where she breaks down a computer science concept every Monday.](https://medium.com/basecs) Her newest article on counting sorts is a great read, and she gives away stickers to readers!

Have a great week, everybody!
