Happy Monday! It's the holiday weekend (happy 4th, everyone), so I have a little extra time to play with code that I've been wanting to play around with for a while. For those who like AWS, I wrote a quick blog post on AWS Lambda's basic setup.

A quick weekend recap: I had brunch this weekend with friends, and got to meet the awesome Charity Majors (Founder of [Honeycomb.io](https://twitter.com/honeycombio) and [@mipsytipsy](https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy) on Twitter)!

It was a hot one in Portland on Sunday (88\*!), so Dave, my friend Kate and I also went on a hike to Ramona Falls on Mt Hood, followed by a very pink beer at Ex Novo.

Here's what's going on in Portland this week and next week:

### Events

If you're in PDX tech:

They're running a four hour lab focused on how to use Azure for IoT. Free food, coffee and workshop for all who attend.

PDXNode is an awesome group, and this month they're starting off with a friendly Node quiz! Prizes include awesome learning materials sponsored by Cloudflare (eg. Books like "Effective JavaScript" by David Herman, and "Node.js in Action" by Harter, Cantelon, Rajlich, and Holowaychuk).

Our July Networking Night will be hosted by the W+K Lodge, Wieden + Kennedy's design engineering group. There will be a series of workshops including an Intro to VR Development, a Live Art Demo of Google’s Tilt Brush app, and a Build Your Own LED Bracelet Wearable. Come by!

Promoting my usual two running meetups; if you need a crew of people to run with, come join us:

### Articles

Here are a few articles, podcasts and assorted things that I’ve enjoyed over the past week — give yourself a little mental boost on your Monday morning:

- Really enjoyed @noopkat's livestream this week, [where she did a live unboxing of the newest AdaBox 004 and worked an avrgirl-arduino.](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/156064343) I'm a big fan of her streams in general, but really liked this one.
- Tomomi Imura wrote a great blog post on [building a sentiment analysis bot with IBM Watson and Raspberry Pi.](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/building-a-sentiment-analysis-bot-with-ibm-watson-and-raspberry-pi-eeb399bb8803) She uses Express and ngrok, so the code is very accessible. I have a Raspberry Pi 2, and tried spinning up the Express server - going to head to Ctrl-H this week and see if I can use their 3D printer, instead of ordering IBM's TJBot.
- This is not at all light reading, but a good friend recently recommended [Functional-Light JavaScript by Kyle Sampson, author of 'You Don't Know JS', one of my favorite series.](https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS/tree/1681b7d181367066edd3bb81c4cc18ff44ed7406) I want to get better at functional programming and organizing by code and this has been a good read so far - tempted to get a physical copy so I can read it out in the sun and take a pen to it.
- Finally, a shoutout to [Vaidehi Joshi's Base CS Series, where she breaks down a computer science concept every Monday.](https://medium.com/basecs) Her newest article on heaps is a great read.

Have a great week, everybody!
