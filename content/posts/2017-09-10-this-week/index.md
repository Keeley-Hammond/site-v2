It's been a while since I updated this site, and I want to get better about charting out my accomplishments and keeping up with my React coding.

So, this week, I:

- Set up a Windows CI/CD pipeline
- Wrote a risk assessment answer doc for our security team
- Figured out how to debug my functional tests not working after about 4 hours and several days of Googling - was is Robot.js, part of Electron's framework? Was it electron-mocha? Turns out, it was just needing to `rm -rf node_modules` and reinstall with npm. Thank you, GitHub commentor on the electron-builder issues forum.
- Successfully deployed a full build to S3 and did it using SHA versioning.
- Successfully replicated a Go environment
- Learned about Go make files and vendoring vs `go get`

### Articles

Here are a few articles, podcasts and assorted things that I’ve enjoyed over the past week — give yourself a little mental boost on your Monday morning:

- Dev.To ran a good #devdiscuss this week about good and bad programming habits. [You can read some of the highlights here, or click the hashtag on Twitter.](https://dev.to/thepracticaldev/good-and-bad-dev-habits-from-perfectionism-and-to-git-commit-messages)
- Wired had an article this week that was getting passed around my Twitter timeline, [about making code more tinkerer friendly.](https://www.wired.com/story/clive-thompson-tinker-with-code/) I remember messing with my first bits of code on Xanga and Gaia Online, and love the concept.
- Speaking of tinker-friendly: I want to give a shout out to Glitch, which I just started using for a Leaflet project with Hack Oregon; [you can view and remix my project here.](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/grocery-geojson) Uses some QGIS and geoJSON, but would love people to tinker with it.
- Finally, I've been reviewing some JavaScript basics for a new project and [found this excellent article on hoisting.](https://dev.to/imwiss/understanding-hoisting-in-javascript) It covers a pretty basic concept, but was a good refresher.

Have a great week, everybody!
