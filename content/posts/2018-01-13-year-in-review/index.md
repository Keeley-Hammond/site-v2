  - Year In Review

2017 was a year of huge changes. I changed careers, homes, added family members and finally became a software engineer.

Testing adding a second paragraph here.

## Professional

In January, I finally left Think Shift, the agency that had been my professional home for almost 7 years. It was hard to leave - I had a lot of great friends and several mentors who had helped me gain the career that I'd had. But I could also feel myself hitting a ceiling.

What's more, I didn't just leave Think Shift for another job - I left Think Shift for an entirely different career.

I joined Alchemy Code Lab in February for a five month, full-time JavaScript bootcamp. It was one of the most terrifying things I've ever done. I remember walking into the class on my first day (20 minutes early, a good habit I'd developed at Think Shift), looking around and wondering what in the hell I was doing.

I graduated from Alchemy Code Lab in June and immediately went home to spend a week with my family in Ohio. They had a lot of questions: "So, where are you interviewing? Do you think you'll have a job soon?"

In August, I interviewed for a full-time position at InVision. I was so excited to work for them that I threw out anything - I was happy to take an internship, either paid or unpaid.

## Community

At the end of 2016, I started attending more Women Who Code events in an effort to get to know the people that I would soon be working with. Toward the beginning of the year, I wanted to see the movie _Hidden Figures_, but didn't have anyone who would go with me. So I posted in the Women Who Code slack channel:

"Anyone want to go see Hidden Figures on Jan. 12?"

Caterina asked me if I would like to host an event. So, I thought, why not?

Caterina asked me to join the WWC leadership team in February, and I eagerly accepted. Starting in January of 2018, I am now the Open Source Lead for Women Who Code.

## Personal

In September of 2016, Dave and I tied the knot after being together for 6 years. When I was about to leave Think Shift at the beginning of the year, we had several very serious and very heavy conversations. How would we manage going from a two income household to a single income one?
